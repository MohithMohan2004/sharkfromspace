# Sharks From Space - Shark Probability Mapping

This project generates interactive shark probability maps using environmental ocean data and machine learning. The project uses a RandomForest model to predict the likelihood of shark presence at given ocean coordinates based on parameters such as sea surface temperature, chlorophyll concentration, ocean depth, current speed, and salinity.  

The maps are output as **interactive heatmaps** using Folium, with high-probability areas highlighted.

## Project Structure

- `ml-trainer.py` : Main Python script that trains the ML model and generates the shark probability heatmap.  
- `synthetic_ocean_data.csv` : Input CSV file containing environmental data (latitude, longitude, SST, chlorophyll, depth, current, salinity).  
- `ultim-gen-syn.py` : Python script to generate **synthetic ocean data** for testing the project.  
- `shark_heatmap.html` : Example output generated by `ml-trainer.py`.
